# Exploratory Analysis of Engagement & Value Patterns

## 1. Project Context
This analysis explores CRM-style engagement data to understand behavioral patterns, value indicators, and segmentation opportunities within real-world systems.

## 2. Analytical Questions
- How does engagement vary across different segments?
- What patterns exist between engagement frequency and value indicators?
- Are there identifiable groups with high engagement but low value (or vice versa)?
- Which variables appear most informative for segmentation?

## 3. Dataset Overview
- Source: Public CRM-style dataset
- Data type: Behavioral, demographic, and engagement metrics
- Unit of analysis: Individual-level records

## 4. Data Quality & Cleaning Plan
- Assess missingness and inconsistent formats
- Standardize dates, categorical variables, and identifiers
- Validate numerical ranges and outliers

## 5. Planned Exploratory Analysis
- Distribution of engagement metrics
- Correlation between engagement and value indicators
- Segment comparisons using descriptive statistics
- Visual exploration of key patterns

## 6. Next Steps
- Feature engineering (recency, frequency indicators)
- Deeper segmentation analysis
- Translate findings into strategic insights
